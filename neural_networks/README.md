## This directory is currently  work in progress

The codes in this directory are related to implmentation of Neural Networks and various models for computation </br> The codes are commented in order to make it beginner-friendly

The codes can be run on a Jupyter Notebook or on a terminal with the commands
```
jupyter notebook <file>.ipynb
```
Notebook format can be used by just renaming the file extension from .py to .ipynb

To run the files normally on terminal
```
python3 <file>.py
```

Python version : 3.10 or above </br>
